Student Name:Andrew Doser

Issues: Lack of haptic feedback for winning/losing.
AI is able to place marks in areas they are not suppose to.
No main menu or indiciation that it is a game or a winning
condition. May add a list of acheivements.

Notes:
Workable Alpha version. AI is a random number generator. Will add
a main menu for next version and highlight winning streak. Will try
to add a way to check for a "CheckMate". Will try to focus on a 
learning curve then give a simple handout of instructions. Should
try an improve AI.

Tester Name: Beau

Silent Test Notes:Clicked full spaces, did not understand to click empty spaces.
Confuse about how he won. Did not know there was an AI. 

Interview Notes:
Clearly, having haptic feedback fo almost every little thing would help the user.
A help button to show how to play the game. However, may not include that and 
try an improve the learning curve.

Issues:
Did not know how to win the game despite winning multiple times. 

Fix:
Highlight winning streak and "pause" game to allow for seeing how they won.

Tester Name: Mitch

Silent Test Notes: 
	NOTE: Tester already knows how to play game
Did not know about AI. Hard time figuring out the point of game.


Interview Notes:
Showing how the player wins would be beneficial. Adding some options
for customization would help

Issues:
Lack of haptic feedback for reset button and opponent. Opponent was
able to place an "O" between two "X"s.  

Fix:
Show that the opponent moved and also add a haptic feedback for reset.
